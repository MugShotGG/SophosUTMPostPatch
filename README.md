# SophosUTMPostPatch
Leverages PoshAcme/Sophos API/OpenSSL



I leverage Posh-Acme for the Cert issue portion. Send them love as they made the cert issue part super easy

Next youll want OpenSSL to do some of the formating for you or it will be a pain

Params are pretty self explanitory: 
IsNewCert, 
Domain,
CertPath,
KeyPath
